@interface ZegoExpressEngine (Mixer)

/// Starts a stream mixing task.
///
/// Due to the performance considerations of the client device, ZegoExpressEngine's mix stream is to start the mixing stream task on the server side of the ZEGO RTC server for mixing stream.
/// After calling this function, SDK initiates a mixing stream request to the ZEGO RTC server. The server will find the current publishing stream and perform video layer blending according to the parameters of the mixing stream task requested by SDK.
/// When you need to update the mixing stream task, that is, the input stream list needs to be updated when the input stream increases or decreases, you can update the field of the [ZegoMixerTask] object inputList and call this function again to pass the same [ZegoMixerTask] object to update the mixing stream task.
/// If an exception occurs when requesting to start the mixing stream task, for example, the most common mix input stream does not exist, it will be given from the callback error code. For specific error codes, please refer to the error codes document https://doc-en.zego.im/en/5548.html for details.
/// If an input stream does not exist in the middle, the mixing stream task will automatically retry playing the input stream for 90 seconds, and will not retry after 90 seconds.
///
/// @param task Stream mixing task object
/// @param callback Start stream mixing task result callback notification

/// Stops a stream mixing task.
///
/// Similar to [startMixerTask], after calling this function, SDK initiates a request to end the mixing stream task to the ZEGO RTC server.
/// If you starts the next mixing stream task without stopping the previous mixing stream task, the previous mixing stream task will not stop automatically. The previous mixing stream task will not be stopped automatically until 90 seconds after the input stream of the previous mixing stream task does not exist.
/// Developers should pay attention when using the stream mixing function that, before starting the next mixer task, they should stop the previous mixer task, so as avoid that when an anchor has start the next mixer task to mix stream with other anchors, and the audience is still playing the previous mixer task's output stream.
